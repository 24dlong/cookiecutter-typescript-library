## Usage

### Installation

This library is published to a private AWS CodeArtifact repository. Instructions for configuring
your application to use this private repository are coming soon.

Additionally, the library is compiled using ESNext, so consuming applications are responsible
for transpiling for older environments if needed.

## Contributing

This library uses:

- TypeScript
- Yarn Berry as the package manager
- Vite as the bundling tool
- Vitest for testing
