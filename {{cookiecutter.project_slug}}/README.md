### Installation

This library is published to a private AWS CodeArtifact repository. Instructions for configuring
your application to use this private repository are coming soon.

## Usage

The library is compiled using TypeScript only and outputs ECMAScript modules (ESM). It is not bundled with tools like Vite or Rollup, so any further bundling or optimization is the responsibility of the consuming application.

## Contributing

This library uses:

- TypeScript
- pnpm as the package manager
- Vitest for testing
